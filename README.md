# noticias-do-front-ep02-app

This is just a repository to store the results of the code used on an episode of my Youtube channel.

There is no lint, tests or good practices.

## Running the app

Initiate react-native local-cli:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Run on iOS simulator:

```sh
$ react-native run-ios
```

## API

It's a very (really) simple API. Only an express server delivering a JSON object with some delay.

For running it:

```sh
$ cd api
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
